  <p>Memo # 1: The Draft </p>
<p> As commissioner of our newly minted Dynasty League my job is to ensure the long-term successes of our fantasy ecosystem. I intend to meet this responsibility with the utmost respect for your time and energy as a participant, and with an awareness of the typical $50-$100 investment and/or actualized personal relationships required to maintain a competitive balance between teams in any league. Having said this, my singular goal as commissioner is to build a culture of full-fledged psychological, emotional, and ultimately financial investment in this league, above all others, as the league you come to think of when you think or speak of Fantasy Football as an owner. All recommendations for improvement shall be considered in coming years. </p>
<p> My secondary goal, as an owner, being to avoid the pits of despair as a fantasy owner who will be tethered to the players chosen in this years draft for the remainder of fantasy eternity (barring future trades and rookie drafts). </p>
<p> If you aren’t prepared to entertain this idea, or meet this opportunity with an open mind then please reconsider your involvement in this league lest we waste time, money and fantasy talent. </p>
<p> This year, is about building equity in the league, creating rivalries, understanding dynamics, getting accustomed to a scoring system which is subject to change on a year to year basis, figuring out what works, figuring out what doesn’t. This year, is about adopting a Dynasty mindset, about creating excitement around our rosters, and hopefully about a rewarding introduction to a team that will live with you forever. This year, is about getting bragging rights as fantasy champion and setting yourself up for future domination and reaping what will more than likely be more than just bragging rights. </p>
<p> The time has come to assemble. But worry not, for as long as I am commissioner this will be a meritocracy. I don’t expect accomplishment of this vision to be an easy feat, as I’m aware many who’ve agreed to join are part of leagues with longstanding traditions. However, I am more than willing to engage in the discourse and decision making processes necessary to appeal to the masses. As such, I hope you’ve all had a dandy time with all your other mock drafts, and I expect you all to meet this drafting opportunity with the significance that it will undoubtedly be remembered for ;) </p>
<p> Good luck in your future endeavors, and remember in Dynasty, it becomes critical to balance the wisdom of past misfortunes with the allure of future abundance.</p>
